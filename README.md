# **Solar Power Prediction Using Linear Regression**

This project is a Solar Power Output Predictor built using a linear regression model. The model predicts the power output of a solar power system based on the given dataset. This project was developed as part of a Week 1 task to explore data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Features
**Data Analysis:**
Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, including:

**Distribution of power output**.
Identifying missing and duplicate values.
Understanding dataset structure (rows, columns, data types, etc.).
Data Visualization:
Visualized the distribution of generated power using histograms for better understanding.

**Prediction Model:**
Implemented a linear regression model to predict solar power output.

**Dataset**
The dataset (solarpowergeneration.csv) contains information related to solar power generation, including attributes like:

generated_power_kw: Power output in kilowatts (dependent variable).
Other relevant features (specify attributes if known).
